From the classic Star Trek; `Engage!` is meant to be your AI agent to help you get more done, more quickly with a simple operating model. 

# How?
Engage is an AI agent with tools to help it
- Gather what you'd like it to react to/assist with (usually SOC alerts)
- A set of tools to help it react to those events
- Markdown playbooks to describe how you'd like the agent to engage

# Examples
Let say you have Chronicle for your SIEM. With Engage you can give it tools and a markdown playbook to:
- Pull new detections
- Summarize the investigation in JIRA
- Ping a user in slack for clarity on the detection
- Ping a security team member in slack to help with the investigation and approve next steps
- Automatically use other tools to help with the investigation, respond, quarantine endpoints, etc
